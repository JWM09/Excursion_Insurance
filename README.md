# Excur-Assure Insurance

The purpose of this application is to allow consumers to protect their investment in excursions while on vacation.  Many times exursions are non-refundable, and people are forced to attend an event in poor weather.  Imagine being motion sick and having to go on a snorkeling when the seas are rough.  Not a great way to spend a day of vacation, but you don't want to lose th $200 you spent.  Enter Exur-Assure.  

Based on the parameters that the user enters we will look at the historical weather results for that day and offer an insurance policy that covers your group against bad weather.  You will be issued an NFT that works as a certificate of insurance and if you file a claim you will be reimbursed accordingly
